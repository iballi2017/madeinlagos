                    <dd>Amazon Lagos is your trusted online marketplace that supports Nigerian entrepreneurs and we have
                        many different sellers competing for business. Therefore, you may see the same product offered
                        by different sellers at different prices. We believe that by supporting these 'third-party'
                        sellers, we can offer you a wider product selection, more choice, increased convenience, and
                        better pricing. </dd>

                    </dt>
                    <dd>Amazon Lagos is a true online marketplace that empowers Nigerians across the country. This means
                        that not all products on Amazon Lagos are sold or delivered by Amazon Lagos. In addition, Amazon
                        Lagos buyers and sellers are found in every state in Nigeria. Given the various factors involved
                        (the time it takes a seller to ship, the courier company used, the distance between buyer and
                        seller, and more) delivery times may vary.</dd>

                        agents, depending on whether the item was sold by Amazon Lagos or a third-party seller and on
                        the delivery method chosen by a third-party seller. You may be called prior to or on the same
